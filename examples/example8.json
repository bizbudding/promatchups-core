He later worked as an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, and Sacramento Kings, where he helped develop young players and contributed to the team's success. His experience and reputation made him a strong candidate for the Brooklyn Nets' head coaching position, and he was officially appointed on April 22, 2024. The Nets have a young and talented roster, but they lack discipline and consistency. Fernández's defensive approach and ability to develop young players make him a good fit for the team.

C **Nikola Jokic** finished with 31 points, 15 rebounds, and 6 assists.\n\nBrooklyn’s losing skid hit 4 with a 121-102 loss vs. the New York Knicks Wednesday.

on Friday\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy CBS Sports Staff\n\nDec 22, 2023 at 5:25 pm ET • 3 min read\n\n!\n\nUSATSI\n\nBarclays Center hosts a matchup between the  and the  on Friday night. The reigning champion Nuggets are 19-10 this season, including back-to-back wins prior to this meeting. The Nets are 13-14 overall and looking to stop a four-game losing streak.  (hamstring) and  (back) are out for the Nets.\n\nFor this game, SportsLine consensus lists the Nuggets as 4.5-point favorites, and tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. The total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, or the over/under, is 230 in the latest Nuggets vs. Nets odds. Before you make any Nets vs. Nuggets picks and NBA predictions, .\n\nThe SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in profit for $100 players on its top-rated  over the past five-plus seasons. The model enters Week 9 of the 2023-24 NBA season on a sizzling 101-52 roll on all top-rated NBA picks dating back to last season, returning well over $4,000. Anyone following it has seen huge returns.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on  and just locked in its picks and NBA predictions. . Now, here are several  and betting lines for Nets vs. Nuggets:\n\n*   Nuggets vs. Nets spread: Nuggets -4.5\n*   Nuggets vs. Nets over/under: 230 points\n*   Nuggets vs. Nets money line: Nuggets -185, Nets +155\n*   Denver: The Nuggets are 6-10 against the spread in road games\n*   Brooklyn: The Nets are 10-3-1 against the spread in home games  \n    \n*   Nuggets vs. Nets picks: \n\nWhy the Nuggets can cover\n-------------------------\n\nDenver's offense keys its overall effectiveness, but its defense is stout this season. The Nuggets are in the top 10 in defensive efficiency, yielding fewer than 1.13 points per possession. Denver is also in the top 10 in second-chance points allowed, 2-point percentage allowed, 3-point percentage allowed, and assists allowed this season. Additionally, the Nuggets are facing a Nets team that struggles mightily in creating free throws, averaging fewer than 20 attempts per game.\n\nOn the offensive side, the Nuggets revolve around two-time NBA MVP , who is averaging 26.5 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.3 assists per game. Jokic is the centerpiece of an offense that is generating almost 1.18 points per possession, and Denver is in the top three in assists (29.6 per game), turnover avoidance (12.1 per game), and points in the paint (55.5 per game). No NBA team has a better assist-to-turnover ratio (2.44) than Denver, and Brooklyn is the league's worst team in turnover creation (11.7 per game) and steals (6.1 per game). .\n\nWhy the Nets can cover\n----------------------\n\nThe Nets have been much better at home than on the road this season, including a stellar +5.1 net rating at Barclays Center. Brooklyn is in the top five of the NBA in 3-point percentage (38.4%) and 3-pointers per game (14.7), and the Nets also boost efficiency on the offensive glass. The Nets are grabbing almost 31% of missed shots this season, a top-10 figure in the NBA, and Brooklyn is above-average in assists (26.0 per game) and turnover avoidance (13.2 per game). Denver is in the bottom five of the league in turnover creation on defense, forcing only 12.4 giveaways per game.\n\nOn the other end, Brooklyn is able to contest shots in strong fashion. The Nets are in the top eight of the league in field goal percentage allowed (45.7%) and 2-point percentage allowed (51.8%). Brooklyn is also adept at preventing free throw attempts, yielding only 21.0 per game, and Denver struggles at the line. The Nuggets are in the bottom five of the league in free throw creation (20.3 attempts per game) and free throw accuracy (72.5%). .\n\nHow to make Nuggets vs. Nets picks\n----------------------------------\n\nSportsLine's model is leaning Under on the total, with only eight players projected to score 11 points or more. The model also says one side of the spread hits in over 50% of simulations. .\n\n**So who wins Nets vs. Nuggets, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time? , and find out.**\n\n### Our Latest NBA Stories\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jerrod-mustaf-former-maryland-star-and-knicks-first-round-pick-dies-at-55/)\n\n#### \n\n##### Sam Quinn • 2 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-joel-embiid-assessed-postgame-technical-foul-for-waving-towel-in-a-game-he-didnt-play-in/)\n\n#### \n\n##### Sam Quinn • 1 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-bucks-are-not-playing-right-so-whats-going-on-with-milwaukees-slow-and-sloppy-start/)\n\n#### \n\n##### James Herbert • 4 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-injury-update-warriors-star-to-miss-multiple-games-with-muscle-strain-in-lower-leg/)\n\n#### \n\n##### Colin Ward-Henninger • 2 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-vs-bucks-odds-line-score-prediction-time-2024-nba-picks-oct-28-best-bets-by-proven-model/)\n\n#### \n\n##### CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-dfs-top-draftkings-fanduel-daily-fantasy-basketball-picks-for-monday-october-28-include-luka-doncic/)\n\n#### \n\n##### CBS Sports Staff • 4 min read\n\nShare\n\n#### Share Video\n\n*   \n*   \n*   \n\nLink copied!\n\n*   !\n    \n    ### Nuggets vs. Nets odds, picks, computer simulations\n    \n    CBS Sports Staff 3 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-bucks-are-not-playing-right-so-whats-going-on-with-milwaukees-slow-and-sloppy-start/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    James Herbert 4 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/every-nba-teams-top-breakout-candidate-for-2024-25-knicks-super-sub-lakers-x-factor-among-players-to-watch/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Colin Ward-Henninger 18 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-nba-is-investigating-joel-embiids-season-opening-absence-and-what-it-means-for-76ers/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Bill Reiter 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-injury-update-warriors-star-to-miss-multiple-games-with-muscle-strain-in-lower-leg/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Colin Ward-Henninger 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-says-he-plans-to-play-in-all-82-games-this-season-and-he-wouldnt-be-first-40-year-old-to-do-so/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Jack Maloney 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-rumors-warriors-jonathan-kuminga-appears-to-already-have-suitor-after-not-signing-extension/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Jack Maloney 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/four-reasons-why-knicks-fans-were-thrilled-with-home-opener-as-new-look-lineup-blows-out-pacers/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Colin Ward-Henninger 3 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jj-redick-is-excelling-as-lakers-coach-and-theyre-not-even-shooting-3-pointers-yet/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Sam Quinn 3 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/bronny-james-expected-to-split-time-between-g-league-and-lakers-per-report/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Jasmyn Wimbish 1 min read\n    \n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n](https://www.sportsline.com/ \"Sportsline text logo\")\n\n!\n\n](https://247sports.com/)\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/)\n\n© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Gambling is not offered on this website in any form.\n\nWe’re set to bring you another betting prediction and pick for today’s action around the NBA as we turn our attention towards this next cross-conference matchup. The **Denver Nuggets (19-10)** will visit the **Brooklyn Nets (13-14)** as both teams are riding different types of momentum. Check out our NBA odds  for our Nuggets-Nets prediction and pick.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets are currently third in the Northwest Division and they’re playing hot right now winning five of their last six games. Particularly, they’re coming into this game riding back-to-back wins over the Dallas Mavericks and Toronto Raptors. They’ve got their swagger back with Murray fully inserted into the lineup and they’ll look for three in a row tonight.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets are currently fourth in the Atlantic Division, but they’re doing a great job of keeping the gap small between them and the leading teams. However, they’ll clearly need to do more in terms of winning as they’ve lost their last four consecutive games. They’re hoping to break their streak and get back into the habit of winning games.\n\n_**Here are the , courtesy of FanDuel.**_\n\n**NBA Odds: Nuggets-Nets Odds**\n-------------------------------\n\nDenver Nuggets: -4.5 (-112)\n\nBrooklyn Nets: +4.5 (-108)\n\nOver: 231.5 (-110)\n\nUnder: 231.5 (-110)\n\n**How to Watch Nuggets vs. Nets**\n---------------------------------\n\nTime: 7:30 p.m. ET/ 4:30 p.m PT\n\nTV: NBA TV, Altitude Sports, YES Network\n\nStream: fuboTV ()\n\n**Why The Nuggets Could Cover The Spread**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\\`The Nuggets come into this game following a solid 113-104 win over the Toronto Raptors in which they controlled the pace of the game through all four quarters. Against good defensive teams, the Nuggets are able to adapt their game and slow the pace down to work their offensive sets. In low-scoring games, the Nuggets have enough strength on defense to come up with crucial stops and they have the offensive firepower to hit the final shot. Prior, they beat the Dallas Mavericks by a whopping 26 point and Jamal Murray has been leading the way since his return to the court.\n\nThe Nuggets see great success when all aspects of their game are meshing well. While they’re not the fastest scoring team or the most dominant on defense, they do all the little things right and winning games for them seems effortless when Jokic and Murray play to their capabilities. They’ll also have confidence knowing they already beat this Nets team by double-digits once before and they’re on a tough losing streak coming in – look for the Nuggets to fully take advantage as they’ll try to jump out to and early lead. Expect Jokic to facilitate for his teammates as Jamal Murray tries his hot hand in the scoring.\n\nRelated NewsArticle continues below\n\n Texans vs. Jets prediction, odds, pick for NFL Week 92h](https://clutchpoints.com/texans-vs-jets-prediction-odds-pick-for-nfl-week-9-2024) Tulane vs. Charlotte prediction, odds, pick for CFB Week 102h](https://clutchpoints.com/tulane-vs-charlotte-prediction-odds-pick-for-cfb-week-10-2024) Kennesaw State vs. Western Kentucky prediction, odds, pick for CFB Week 103h](https://clutchpoints.com/kennesaw-state-vs-western-kentucky-prediction-odds-pick-for-cfb-week-10) Jacksonville State vs. Liberty prediction, odds, pick for CFB Week 104h](https://clutchpoints.com/jacksonville-state-vs-liberty-prediction-odds-pick-for-cfb-week-10)\n\n**Why The Nets Could Cover The Spread**\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets had a winning record prior to their last four consecutive losses and it’s clear that they’ll need to avoid losing streaks at all costs if they want to have any chance of competing in the East. It won’t be easy as Ben Simmons will have to wait another two weeks before returning and role players like Lonnie Walker and Dennis Smith Jr. remain on the injury report. Three of their last four losses have also come by double-digits, so they’re hard-pressed to find answers right now and get back on the winning track. Their last two losses marked poor shooting nights from the field, so they’re hoping for a better performance as short underdogs here.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets are actually one of the best covering teams in the NBA, going 17-9-1 ATS overall and 10-3-1 ATS when playing at home. Clearly they’ve found comfort in playing at Barclay’s Center, but they may not be 100% healthy ahead of this one and they’ll need the fans to will them to a win. With how streaky their shooting has been, rebounding the ball will become a crucial focal point as we could see a high number of missed shots on both sides.\n\n**Final Nuggets-Nets Prediction & Pick**\n----------------------------------------\n\nBoth teams are feeling the meat of their schedule and both come into this game with lengthy injury reports. There’s nothing major ailing either one of their squads, but it’s clear that both teams are beginning to feel the weight of their schedules. In a game like this, we have to favor the defending champs and their ability to hang in the game with their defense. The Nets have struggled to find their shot recently and it’ll become much harder if the Nuggets put the clamps on them defensively. I expect Jokic to have double-digit assists and Jamal Murray to score 30+ as they grab this comfortable win.\n\n**Final Nuggets-Nets Prediction & Pick: Denver Nuggets -4.5 (-112)**\n\n* * *\n\n is a sports writer for ClutchPoints, primarily covering UFC, sneakers, and the NBA.

Nuggets prediction, odds, line, spread, time: 2023 NBA picks, Dec. 22 best bets from proven model\n==========================================================================================================\n\nSportsLine's model just revealed its NBA picks for Brooklyn Nets vs. Denver Nuggets on Friday\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy CBS Sports Staff\n\nDec 22, 2023 at 5:25 pm ET • 3 min read\n\n!\n\nUSATSI\n\nBarclays Center hosts a matchup between the  and the  on Friday night. The reigning champion Nuggets are 19-10 this season, including back-to-back wins prior to this meeting. The Nets are 13-14 overall and looking to stop a four-game losing streak.  (hamstring) and  (back) are out for the Nets.\n\nFor this game, SportsLine consensus lists the Nuggets as 4.5-point favorites, and tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. The total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, or the over/under, is 230 in the latest Nuggets vs. Nets odds. Before you make any Nets vs. Nuggets picks and NBA predictions, .\n\nThe SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in profit for $100 players on its top-rated  over the past five-plus seasons. The model enters Week 9 of the 2023-24 NBA season on a sizzling 101-52 roll on all top-rated NBA picks dating back to last season, returning well over $4,000. Anyone following it has seen huge returns.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on  and just locked in its picks and NBA predictions. . Now, here are several  and betting lines for Nets vs. Nuggets:\n\n*   Nuggets vs. Nets spread: Nuggets -4.5\n*   Nuggets vs. Nets over/under: 230 points\n*   Nuggets vs. Nets money line: Nuggets -185, Nets +155\n*   Denver: The Nuggets are 6-10 against the spread in road games\n*   Brooklyn: The Nets are 10-3-1 against the spread in home games  \n    \n*   Nuggets vs. Nets picks: \n\nWhy the Nuggets can cover\n-------------------------\n\nDenver's offense keys its overall effectiveness, but its defense is stout this season. The Nuggets are in the top 10 in defensive efficiency, yielding fewer than 1.13 points per possession. Denver is also in the top 10 in second-chance points allowed, 2-point percentage allowed, 3-point percentage allowed, and assists allowed this season. Additionally, the Nuggets are facing a Nets team that struggles mightily in creating free throws, averaging fewer than 20 attempts per game.\n\nOn the offensive side, the Nuggets revolve around two-time NBA MVP , who is averaging 26.5 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.3 assists per game. Jokic is the centerpiece of an offense that is generating almost 1.18 points per possession, and Denver is in the top three in assists (29.6 per game), turnover avoidance (12.1 per game), and points in the paint (55.5 per game). No NBA team has a better assist-to-turnover ratio (2.44) than Denver, and Brooklyn is the league's worst team in turnover creation (11.7 per game) and steals (6.1 per game). .\n\nWhy the Nets can cover\n----------------------\n\nThe Nets have been much better at home than on the road this season, including a stellar +5.1 net rating at Barclays Center. Brooklyn is in the top five of the NBA in 3-point percentage (38.4%) and 3-pointers per game (14.7), and the Nets also boost efficiency on the offensive glass. The Nets are grabbing almost 31% of missed shots this season, a top-10 figure in the NBA, and Brooklyn is above-average in assists (26.0 per game) and turnover avoidance (13.2 per game). Denver is in the bottom five of the league in turnover creation on defense, forcing only 12.4 giveaways per game.\n\nOn the other end, Brooklyn is able to contest shots in strong fashion. The Nets are in the top eight of the league in field goal percentage allowed (45.7%) and 2-point percentage allowed (51.8%). Brooklyn is also adept at preventing free throw attempts, yielding only 21.0 per game, and Denver struggles at the line. The Nuggets are in the bottom five of the league in free throw creation (20.3 attempts per game) and free throw accuracy (72.5%). .\n\nHow to make Nuggets vs. Nets picks\n----------------------------------\n\nSportsLine's model is leaning Under on the total, with only eight players projected to score 11 points or more. The model also says one side of the spread hits in over 50% of simulations. .\n\n**So who wins Nets vs. Nuggets, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time? , and find out.**\n\n### Our Latest NBA Stories\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jerrod-mustaf-former-maryland-star-and-knicks-first-round-pick-dies-at-55/)\n\n#### \n\n##### Sam Quinn • 2 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-joel-embiid-assessed-postgame-technical-foul-for-waving-towel-in-a-game-he-didnt-play-in/)\n\n#### \n\n##### Sam Quinn • 1 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-bucks-are-not-playing-right-so-whats-going-on-with-milwaukees-slow-and-sloppy-start/)\n\n#### \n\n##### James Herbert • 4 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-injury-update-warriors-star-to-miss-multiple-games-with-muscle-strain-in-lower-leg/)\n\n#### \n\n##### Colin Ward-Henninger • 2 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-vs-bucks-odds-line-score-prediction-time-2024-nba-picks-oct-28-best-bets-by-proven-model/)\n\n#### \n\n##### CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-dfs-top-draftkings-fanduel-daily-fantasy-basketball-picks-for-monday-october-28-include-luka-doncic/)\n\n#### \n\n##### CBS Sports Staff • 4 min read\n\nShare\n\n#### Share Video\n\n*   \n*   \n*   \n\nLink copied!\n\n*   !\n    \n    ### Nuggets vs. Nets odds, picks, computer simulations\n    \n    CBS Sports Staff 3 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-bucks-are-not-playing-right-so-whats-going-on-with-milwaukees-slow-and-sloppy-start/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    James Herbert 4 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/every-nba-teams-top-breakout-candidate-for-2024-25-knicks-super-sub-lakers-x-factor-among-players-to-watch/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Colin Ward-Henninger 18 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-nba-is-investigating-joel-embiids-season-opening-absence-and-what-it-means-for-76ers/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Bill Reiter 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-injury-update-warriors-star-to-miss-multiple-games-with-muscle-strain-in-lower-leg/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Colin Ward-Henninger 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-says-he-plans-to-play-in-all-82-games-this-season-and-he-wouldnt-be-first-40-year-old-to-do-so/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Jack Maloney 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-rumors-warriors-jonathan-kuminga-appears-to-already-have-suitor-after-not-signing-extension/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Jack Maloney 2 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/four-reasons-why-knicks-fans-were-thrilled-with-home-opener-as-new-look-lineup-blows-out-pacers/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Colin Ward-Henninger 3 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jj-redick-is-excelling-as-lakers-coach-and-theyre-not-even-shooting-3-pointers-yet/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Sam Quinn 3 min read\n    \n*   ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/bronny-james-expected-to-split-time-between-g-league-and-lakers-per-report/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    Jasmyn Wimbish 1 min read\n    \n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n](https://www.sportsline.com/ \"Sportsline text logo\")\n\n!\n\n](https://247sports.com/)\n\n](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/)\n\n© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

They have a superstar leading the way, an elite second option, and a slew of really good players who could have bigger roles elsewhere yet chose to be part of something more meaningful.\n\nAll of that could have been said about the Golden State Warriors when they won their first of their four most recent titles in 2015.\n\nNow, it’s the Nuggets who are following a similar — and proven — formula.\n\n“You know, Pat Riley said something many years ago,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said after it was all over. “I used to have it up on my board when I was a head coach in Sacramento, and it talked about the evolution in this game and how you go from a nobody to an upstart, and you go from an upstart to a winner and a winner to a contender and a contender to a champion, and the last step is after a champion is to be a dynasty.”\n\nEven in a championship moment, Malone is already thinking about more. Riley, the Heat president and a nine-time champion as a coach, player and executive, is wired the same way.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n      ](https://apnews.com/article/paolo-banchero-orlando-d73147c19aa9ab9889d64a66472cadfb)\n\n\n\n      ](https://apnews.com/article/dwyane-wade-statue-52c3a4b92fd18582b256852c60e5c7c6)\n\n\n\n      ](https://apnews.com/article/curry-ankle-warriors-add31c5afc465fd043d22401a9e0464c)\n\n\n\nIt’s not crazy to think the Nuggets can do more. For starters, they have Nikola Jokic.\n\nThere are other stars who stand out in their own ways — Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid replaced Jokic as MVP this year, past MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of Milwaukee may be the best two-way player in the league, Dallas’ Luka Doncic is surely going to be an MVP before long — but there’s no other Jokic, who has gone from second-round pick to triple-double machine.\n\nIt’s time to end all debate about Jokic. He’s slow, can’t jump and will never wow anyone with athleticism. And none of that matters. He’s smart, he’s selfless and he’s unstoppable. Period. End of story. The best player in the playoffs, the NBA Finals MVP, and now the big man from Sombor, Serbia is a champion. The days of any Jokic slander being allowed are officially over.\n\n“I think there’s more to come, actually, from Jok,” Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. “I think we haven’t seen a side of Jok that we are going to see where he can be just pure dominance all the way, the whole game, even more than he has been.”\n\nHere’s what the other 29 teams should say when they hear that: “Yikes.”\n\nMurray is to Jokic what Dwyane Wade was to LeBron James, what Kobe Bryant was to Shaquille O’Neal (before it became the other way around), what Scottie Pippen was to Michael Jordan. He is Robin next to Batman, a guy who would be a No. 1 option on many other teams yet checked his ego at the door and made it work in Denver.\n\nMurray has sacrificed some stats. Some spotlight, too. The championship ring that he’ll be getting this fall, however, will have exactly the same amount of diamonds as the one Jokic will get. It all evens out.\n\n“To be here just kind of rounds it out and shows that when we are given the right circumstances and everybody healthy, God willing, we can do it,” Murray said. “I think when we’re playing our best basketball, we are a very hard team to stop.”\n\nIt’s difficult to argue that point.\n\nTo be fair, this wasn’t the toughest path a team ever took to a title. Denver beat two No. 8 seeds — Minnesota and Miami — along with a No. 7 seed in the Los Angeles Lakers and a No. 4 seed in Phoenix to win this championship. But it was dominant. The Nuggets never trailed in a series. They went 16-4 in the postseason. They won 10 of their final 11 games. They left no doubt.\n\nMalone was an assistant coach in Golden State just as the Warriors were starting down the path of becoming the NBA’s immovable object. He left two years before Stephen Curry’s first title to take over in Sacramento, getting fired early into Year 2 there. Then Denver hired him, and his first three seasons there resulted in zero playoff appearances. Usually, that gets a guy fired.\n\nThe Nuggets kept him. The debt was repaid in full on Monday night. Patience paid off, and so did institutional belief that Malone was the right guy, that Jokic — the greatest No. 41 pick in NBA draft history — would become a great, that Denver was building something the right way.\n\n“You know, it’s not for everybody,” Malone said. “This was the best course for us, and it’s allowed us to get here.”\n\nIt very well may allow them to stay there.\n\nWinning isn’t easy and winning a championship is darn near impossible. There have been five different champions in the last five years now. Three of those titlists — Toronto (2019), the Lakers (2020) and Milwaukee (2021) — have since fired the coaches who won those championships. Getting to the top is hard. Staying on top is tougher. Malone knows this, and starting this fall, the Nuggets are going to learn it.\n\nBut he thinks they’re also built for whatever comes next.\n\n“We’re not satisfied,” Malone said. “We accomplished something this franchise has never done before, but we have a lot of young talented players in that locker room, and I think we just showed through 16 playoff wins what we’re capable of on the biggest stage in the world.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n------\n\nTim Reynolds is a national basketball writer for The Associated Press.
