	"resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as the winning team being either the Minnesota Timberwolves or the Dallas Mavericks based on which team scores more points at the end of their game on October 29, 2024.",
	"reasoning": "The Timberwolves have shown they can capitalize on roster depth and strong starts from star players. Their strategic roster moves indicate a focus on winning. Meanwhile, the Mavericks face challenges in consistency, and though Doncic's exploits are legendary, support may be lacking. Minnesota's home court advantage and form over the past games additionally supports the forecast.",

Lines last updated at 8:58 p.m. ET.\n\n*   **Moneyline (ML)**: Mavericks +166 (bet $100 to win $166) | Timberwolves -198 (bet $198 to win $100)\n*   **Against the spread**: Mavericks +4.5 (-108) | Timberwolves -4.5 (-114)\n*   **Over/Under (O/U)**: 209.5 (O: -110 | U: -110)\n\nMavericks at Timberwolves key injuries\n--------------------------------------\n\nMavericks\n\n*   G **Luka Doncic** (knee, ankle) questionable\n*   C **Dereck Lively II** (neck) questionable\n\nTimberwolves\n\n*   G **Mike Conley** (Achilles) questionable\n\nFor most recent updates: .\n\nPlay our free daily **** and win! ****!\n\nMavericks at Timberwolves picks and predictions\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n### Prediction\n\nTimberwolves 107, Mavericks 105\n\n### \n\n**PASS**.\n\nUnless one would rather back the Mavs on the moneyline than the spread, there’s not much value here. The Wolves (-198) are too pricey, and the Mavs have had each of their 1st 2 series end in 6 games.\n\nExpect Minnesota to come out on top here, but avoid taking it at -198.\n\n### \n\n**LEAN MAVERICKS +4.5** (**\\-108**).\n\nIn NBA standards, these games have had ultra-close finishes. All 4 games have been single-digit victories, and 3 of the 4 have been won by 5 or fewer points. The Mavericks are 5-1 ATS as underdogs in the postseason, and they are 4-0 ATS through their last 4 games on the road.\n\nMinnesota had a perfect style of play to down Denver and throttled a disoriented Phoenix team. While those were impressive, the Mavs have shown to be a more challenging matchup, and this should continue to be a hard-fought series. Since May 10, the Wolves have been favored 5 times and are 1-4 ATS in those games.\n\nBack **MAVERICKS +4.5** (**\\-108**).\n\n### \n\n**BET OVER 209.5** (**\\-110**).\n\nBoth teams are trending towards the Over, as is the series as a whole.\n\nThe Wolves have gone Over in 6 of their last 9 and are 5-2 O/U in their 7 home playoff games this season. Similarly, the Mavs have gone Over in 8 of their last 13 games and are 4-2 O/U in their last 6 on the road.\n\nThree of 4 games in the series have gone Over, and in the lone one that didn’t, the Mavs shot 42% while G **Kyrie Irving** and Doncic combined to hit just 13 of 39 from the field. The superstars should play better in their 2nd potential close-out game.\n\nBack **OVER 209.5** (**\\-110**).\n\n**For more sports betting picks and tips**, check out  and .\n\n_Follow @nathanbeighle\\_ on  Follow SportsbookWire on  and like us on _.\n\n**Access more NBA coverage:**  \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n\n### More \n\n### \n\n### \n\n### \n\nSee  via , our preferred  odds partner.

Timberwolves Prediction, Picks, Odds for Tonight’s NBA Playoff Game\n================================================================================\n\nThe Timberwolves have a clear height advantage vs. the Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, and our NBA betting picks expect Karl-Anthony Towns to take advantage of mismatches in Game 1.\n\n!\n\n • Betting Analyst\n\nMay 22, 2024 • 17:25 ET • 4 min read\n\n!This article contains predictions for an old game!\n\n\n\n    !\n\nPhoto By - USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves may still be riding high from their historic comeback to win Game 7 in Denver. Their fans certainly still are. Then again, Target Center was just as high for Game 3 of the last series, and that led to a Nuggets rout.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks have reason to believe in an upset tonight. But do they have reason to believe they can slow down the player currently shining brightest for Minnesota? No, that is not Anthony Edwards.\n\nRather, our free  will put faith in the longest-tenured Timberwolf as we dig into Mavs vs Timberwolves predictions for Wednesday, May 22. And don't miss Jon Metler's  for Game 1!\n\nMavs vs Timberwolves prediction\n-------------------------------\n\n**My best bet**  \nKarl-Anthony Towns Over 19.5 points ()\n\n**Best odds available in your region**\n\n**My analysis  \n**Who on the  roster is the best matchup for the ' most versatile offensive threat? And make no mistake, no matter how high ’ star reaches this postseason,  remains the best offensive piece for the Timberwolves, though he's sometimes inconsistent.\n\nThe last time 6-foot-7 P.J. Washington began a game as Towns’ primary defender, Towns scored 62 points in January. He will not get this assignment.\n\nDaniel Gafford, 6-foot-10, has been starting this postseason and then yielding many minutes to rookie Dereck Lively II. Gafford is many things — an energetic player, an attacking rebounder, an excellent lob finisher — but a defensive ace is not among them. Towns’ variety of post moves will bother Gafford, and Gafford cannot sell out against them because Towns will also make him work from the perimeter.\n\nLively’s 7-foot-1 length may be a better matchup, but the rookie would be in well over his head. And, again, he has not been starting.\n\nWith Minnesota starting both Towns and , playing them both notably more than 30 minutes per game last round, despite the series being rife with blowouts, Dallas needs to find a way to play two bigs more regularly. Washington as the second-biggest Maverick on the floor for many minutes will be an recipe for interior disaster.\n\nThis is where the loss of Maxi Kleber (shoulder injury, possibly returning by the end of the series) looms largest. He may not seem a significant defensive piece, but Kleber would be a better matchup than Washington, and he would give Dallas a semblance of size.\n\nAs is, Jason Kidd’s best option may be to play both Lively and Gafford — possibly to the detriment of Derrick Jones Jr., though that would then force Washington or Luka Doncic to hang with Edwards. Even with that lineup, Towns will be going against an overmatched defender.\n\nAfter Towns excelled defensively the last two series, somewhat slowing Kevin Durant and Nikola Jokic, he should now have a chance to dominate offensively. He has cracked 20 points in five of his last eight games, showing increasing lower-body strength only two months removed from knee surgery.\n\nHe might crack 20 points in five of the games in this series.\n\n\n\nMavericks vs Timberwolves same-game parlay (SGP)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n](https://www.covers.com/betting/sportsbookredirect?sportsbookId=29&slug=betrivers&vertical=betting&location=editorial)\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns Over 19.5 points  \n  \nRudy Gobert Over 12.5 points  \n  \nNaz Reid Over 9.5 points\n\n\n\nBetting all three of these player points Overs is a risk. They could arguably take away from each other. But if Dallas has no one to defend Towns, that may open up interior chances for Gobert. If Dallas has no one to defend Towns, that could open up outside looks for  when Towns draws double teams.\n\nMany coaches wait until after Game 1 to make any drastic adjustments. They do not want to get ahead of themselves and overcorrect before they see reality.\n\nThe obvious defensive choice for the Mavericks is to worry about Edwards. If he has not been doubled this postseason, he has exploded. But the combination of worrying about Edwards and not having multiple worthwhile bigs on the court should lead to many, many chances for Minnesota’s trio of big men.\n\n\n\nMavericks vs Timberwolves odds\n------------------------------\n\n### Mavericks vs Timberwolves live odds\n\nGet the latest Mavericks vs Timberwolves  for Game 1.\n\n### Mavericks vs Timberwolves opening odds\n\n*   **Spread**: Dallas +4 | Minnesota -4\n*   **Moneyline**: Dallas +150 | Minnesota -167\n*   **Over/Under**: Over 206 | Under 206\n\n### Mavericks vs Timberwolves spread and Over/Under analysis\n\n*   The Timberwolves opened as 4-point favorites after their dramatic Game 7 victory, a number that held steady until rising to -4.5 on early Wednesday morning.\n*   The total hit the market at 206.5 and peaked at 208 in Wednesday’s earliest hours before returning to 206.5. The low number is an endorsement of Minnesota’s defense, while the brief move may have been a nod toward some public money.\n*   The betting splits at BetMGM, as of Wednesday morning, do not yield much insight. A slight majority of bettors and money back the Timberwolves at -4.5 and 60% of bettors and money siding with the Over 206.5.\n\nMavericks vs Timberwolves trend\n-------------------------------\n\nMinnesota’s four wins last round all included an Under cashing.

His betting habits and coverage follow that same pattern. He covered Notre Dame football for various outlets from 2008 to 2024, most notably spending eight seasons as NBC Sports’ beat writer on the Irish. That was also when his gambling focus took off. Knowing there were veteran beat writers with three decades more experience than he had, Douglas found his niche by best recognizing Notre Dame’s standing in each year’s national landscape, a complex tapestry most easily understood and remembered via betting odds.\n\nIn 2021, that interest created a freelance opportunity with Covers, a role that eventually led to Douglas joining the company full-time in 2023. In the fall, Douglas will place five or six dozen bets each week, a disproportionate amount via BetRivers because the operator tends to have lines slightly different than the rest of the market. The same can be said of Circa Sports’ futures markets.\n\nWhile Douglas is an avid NBA fan and covers the league throughout the year, the vast majority of his bets are on college football, because that is the biggest key to sports betting: Know what you do not know.\n\nRead More\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n   \n\n### Recent Picks\n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n### Popular Content\n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n! \n\n### Smarter sports betting\n\n  \n\n### Legal US sports betting\n\n                      \n\n### Legal Canadian sports betting\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe Covers community has\n\n618,670\n\nlifetime members worldwide\n\n\n\n!

So, where does the betting value lie in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals?\n\nRead below for our five **NBA best bets** for **Mavericks vs. Timberwolves Game 5** on **Thursday, May 30** — featuring two **picks against the spread** and **predictions** for three different **props**.\n\n**NBA Best Bets: Mavericks vs Timberwolves Game 5 (Thursday, May 30)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMavericks vs. Timberwolves\n--------------------------\n\nBy \n\nThe Wolves have their backs against the wall for a second-consecutive elimination game and if they have any hope of extending this series, they’ll need to come out with energy in the first two frames — something they’ve done in three of the four games already (3-1 ATS in the first half this series).\n\nShams Charania reported that Mavericks center Dereck Lively II could play in Game 5 but I don’t think that’s likely in a game that isn’t nearly as dire for Dallas as it is Minnesota. He looked like he suffered a concussion, and while I’m not claiming to be a doctor, I do think it makes sense not to rush Lively back despite how critical he’s been for the Mavericks.\n\nLively's on/off numbers are fantastic. The Mavericks have a 122.7 offensive rating and 105 defensive rating when Lively is on the court these playoffs, and a 111.7 offensive and 117.6 defensive rating without him (+23.6 Net per Basketball Reference).\n\nI think Minnesota wins the game, but the Mavs have been an excellent second-half team this postseason (11-3-2 ATS), and I trust their late-game offense much more than the Wolves. Dallas owns a Net Rating of -5.5 on the road in the first half though, compared to the Wolves +3.2 at home.\n\nFinally, the line is also a bit too long for the full game, and in the Conference Finals, that’s not something I want to worry about. Since last season, favorites laying -4 or more are just 2-12 ATS and 7-7 straight up. Fading those big favorites on the moneyline gets you a 43% ROI going back to the 2021 season.\n\nI’ll bank on the Wolves creating separation by halftime and take them -2.5 in the first half.\n\n#### **Pick: Timberwolves 1H -2.5 (-110)**\n\n* * *\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"#1\"><img width=\"42\" height=\"42\" sizes=\"42px\" alt=\"Dallas Mavericks Logo\"

Lively and racked up 15 rebounds on 17 rebound chances. While this is an incredible conversion rate, Luka has a 66% conversion rate during the playoffs.\n\nThe biggest thing is Lively’s absence. Given the neck injury, and how early he was ruled out of Game 4, I'm skeptical about his availability in Game 5 when the initial expectations were that he could be ready to go by the Finals.\n\nLuka has gone over this line in six of his last nine outings without Lively, but with Gafford also averaging 10.9 rebounds on 14.4 chances.\n\nI expect Luka to be the best rebounding option for Dallas, and for him to record double-digit boards in Game 5.\n\n#### **Pick: Luka Doncic Over 9.5 Rebounds (-102)**\n\n* * *\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"#1\"><img width=\"42\"

frustrating to see Towns struggle with efficiency, but the volume has been there. Towns scored 25 on an efficient 9-of-13 from the field in Game 4, but likely would have been able to reach 30 points if he could’ve kept himself out of foul trouble.\n\nTowns also led the Wolves with a +15 plus-minus, so I have less fear of him being benched for Naz Reid here as Towns actually made a tremendously positive impact on the game in multiple ways.\n\nTowns is talented enough to score 30 or 35 points here but as long as he can stay at just average efficiency he should be able to reach 20 points tonight.\n\nTrust Towns to reach this number and sprinkle his alt lines at 25+ and 30+ points as well.\n\n#### **Pick: Karl-Anthony Towns Over 19.5 Points (-120)**\n\n* * *\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"#1\"><img width=\"42\" height=\"42\" sizes=\"42px\"

back-and-forth affairs. In fact, this bet, for there to be any other result at the end of every quarter, has hit every game this series.\n\nBoth of these teams have stretches defensively where they are super locked in, and able to shut the other team down, which leads to extended runs. This has led to comebacks in both directions.\n\nLuka left a lot on the table Tuesday, and I think he will come out super-aggressive tonight. At the same time, Minnesota is at home, and has a great shot here.\n\nI think this is a back-and-forth affair, and instead of trying to figure out who will come out on top, I’d rather jump on the bet that has hit for four straight games. Betting .25u on any other result at -126 on FanDuel.\n\n#### **Pick: To Lead After Every Quarter – Neither Team (-126)**\n\n* * *\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"#1\"><img

ATS run since 2013 as Minnesota may be a threat to make things interesting in this series. It has been an incredibly even series as the difference between the current status of Dallas being up 3-1, and the series being over with a 4-0 Minnesota sweep comes down to only a few plays.\n\nThe Wolves lost Game 1 at home in a tough situation following an emphatic Game 7 win over Denver, while Game 2 was a fluke loss in a game the Wolves deserved to win. Minnesota has had a lead with less than five minutes remaining in all four games in this series and has been the better outside shooting team.\n\nLuka Doncic and Kyrie Irving fell short of their early series performances in Game 4, and with Doncic's multiple ailments, the longer the series goes the worse his chances of being at full strength. Minnesota has outshot Dallas but has not been able to pull away in this series including winning by only five despite a 10% edge in field goal rate in Game 4 with turnovers and free throws favoring Dallas.\n\nMinnesota missed nine free throw attempts on Tuesday while conceding 30 points off 15 turnovers. Dallas had 14 turnovers but those led to only 15 points for Minnesota and those numbers should be expected to normalize. The Wolves were the better team in the regular season and a case can be made they have been the better team in this series by a reasonable margin despite the close finishes and the late game bounces favoring Dallas.\n\nEarly market support appears to be with Minnesota, as -4.5 stands as an appealing price considering Minnesota closed at -6 in Game 2 at home.\n\n#### **Pick: Timberwolves -4.5 (-112)**\n\n* * *\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"#1\"><img width=\"42\" height=\"42\" sizes=\"42px\" alt=\"Dallas Mavericks Logo\"

Their stock couldn’t be higher.\n\nBut this is actually a great spot to fade the trendy Wolves and back the Mavericks, who closed out their previous series in six games against the No. 1-seed Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nFormer Action Network writer Raheem Palmer found a great trend to fade teams in Game 1 after coming off a Game 7 in their previous series. Teams coming off a Game 7 are just 34-54 in Game 1 of the following series since 1988.\n\nI think Dallas has the lineup versatility to challenge a potentially tired Minnesota team, and I like the Mavericks +4.5 and a sprinkle on the moneyline to win a half-unit.\n\nPick: Mavericks +4.5 (-110)\n\n](https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/v2/deeplink?deeplinkId[0]=ML787940870&bookId=108&context=qs-admin)\n\n**What is QuickSlip?**\n\n> QuickSlip is an Action Network feature that allows users to automatically pre-load their bet slip at .\n\n* * *\n\nMavericks +4.5\n--------------\n\nBy \n\nAction Network tweeted on May 7 that \"teams coming off a Game 7 facing a team that did not go seven games are 16-29-1 ATS in Game 1 over the last 20 years.\"\n\nThat was prior to the Cleveland Cavaliers — 12.5-point underdogs — getting blown out by the Boston Celtics, 120-95, in Game 1 of their series.\n\nThis is being written before Celtics vs. Pacers Game 1 on Tuesday night, but a bunch of us jumped on the Celtics in that -9.5, -10 territory.\n\nSo, the updated number is now 16-30-1 ATS with that Cavs loss.\n\nGame 1 feels like a letdown spot for the Timberwolves. And given the sheer physicality of the Wolves' last series, I'd lean Dallas to win outright.\n\nI think Dallas is more live in this series than people realize.\n\n#### **Pick: Mavericks +4.5**\n\n* *

Pts</div></a></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n* * *\n\nOver 207.5\n----------\n\nBy \n\nThis is a surprising over for me, but I feel confident in the play.\n\nDespite the Wolves' excellent defense — and they put on a masterclass in the second half of Game 7 — they’ve been inconsistent, and they’re coming off a seven-game series.\n\nI expect their defense to falter against Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\n\nThe Dallas defense has also been excellent, but it's been the fifth-fastest team in the league, per NBA Advanced Stats, despite Luka’s proclivity to slow the pace down in the half-court.\n\nA product of the Mavs' savvy defense has been transition buckets.\n\nI think the Mavs win a high scoring one relative to the low-posted total.\n\n#### **Pick: Over 206.5**\n\nPick: Over 206.5 (-112)\n\n](https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/v2/deeplink?deeplinkId[0]=ML787940803&bookId=108&context=qs-admin)\n\nFALSE\n\n* * *\n\nDallas to Win Game 1 / Wolves to Win Series +500\n------------------------------------------------\n\nBy \n\nOur metrics lean towards Dallas covering Game 1 (if not possibly winning straight up), and given that the Wolves just went seven games with the Nuggets, why not?\n\nThe Mavericks will have the rest advantage and are 4-2 on the road in the playoffs. Minnesota is just 3-2 at home and was 1-2 in the Denver series.\n\nDoncic is somewhat of a playoff road warrior, Irving is generally as unfazed as you'd want a guard to be in the playoffs and Dallas' defense is, at worst, legit.\n\nThis series profiles as a six or seven gamer, and this bet is my favorite long shot on the board.\n\n#### **Pick: Dallas to Win Game 1 / Wolves to Win Series +500**\n\n* * *\n\nOver 5.5 Games in Series (-175)\n-------------------------------\n\nBy \n\nYou'd want more value, sure, but this series should be a long one.\n\nNeither side is overwhelming enough to warrant confidence in a short series in their favor.\n\nNeither team is injured to the point of no return going into the series.\n\nAnd no team has the profile to have our definitive trust in all moments going forward.\n\nMinnesota arguably toppled the one team in the playoff that did, but even Denver's regular season profile wasn't to the level of last season. And in hindsight, more questions should've been asked (amongst casual observers and on the TV shows) about the Nuggets' depth.\n\nBarring injuries, I just don't think this ends in five. The Wolves are great defensively but have their offensive shortcomings. The Mavericks can guard to a higher apex than the Nuggets, and their offense isn't always fluid either.\n\nCan P.J. Washington and Derrick Jones Jr. continue to shoot 3s? Will Karl-Anthony Towns revert to his initial playoff self? Will Doncic have his way in the pick-and-roll? Will the Wolves neutralize Irving's scoring like OKC did?\n\nThere are too many questions that will need games of problem solving. Give me the over.\n\n#### **Pick: Over 5.5 Games in Series (-175)**\n\n* * *\n\nMavs 1Q ML +120\n---------------\n\nBy \n\nThe Wolves are a team that starts slow and dominates in fourth quarters. They also come into this game with a rest disadvantage, and this is a potential early letdown spot after the biggest win in franchise history.\n\nOn the opposite side, the Mavericks have been starting strong recently, crushing the Thunder in first quarters of their last series.\n\nThe change for Dallas has been a 1-to-2 minute uptick in early playing time for Kyrie.\n\nIf they're extending Kyrie a bit more, take Dallas 1Q ML.\n\nPick: Mavericks 1Q Moneyline (+128)\n\n](https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/v2/deeplink?deeplinkId[0]=ML788495634&bookId=108&context=qs-admin)\n\n* * *\n\n<table

Pts</div></a></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n* * *\n\nKyrie Irving to Score 30+ Points\n--------------------------------\n\nBy \n\nMinnesota's base defense against Kyrie will likely be to let the Mavs set picks with whoever Rudy Gobert is guarding and have the center drop and hope to get over the screen.\n\nThis is what they've done in the past against Kyrie and what they did against Jamal Murray at the end of the last series. Aside from Game 7, Murray couldn’t really make the Wolves pay.\n\nKyrie, on the other hand, can. They also may start with Mike Conley on him — a matchup Kyrie could cook — since there isn’t a great Conley hiding spot.\n\nKyrie has 30+ in his last three games against Minnesota. He's been boom-or-bust in these playoffs, scoring 30+ three times and 23 or fewer in the other nine games.\n\nAt +500, this is worth a sprinkle. I'm betting .25u on Irving to have 30+ points at +500 on  (I would bet it down to +425).\n\nFor a bonus, the last two times Kyrie, Luka and Anthony Edwards all played in a Dallas/Minnesota game, they each had 30+. The playoffs are a different animal, but I think this series is very unpredictable, and I wouldn’t be shocked if all three did it again.\n\nI'm adding .05u on each to have 30+ at +2612 on FanDuel.\n\n#### **Pick: Kyrie Irving to Score 30+ Points**\n\n](https://action.onelink.me/qhpb/b9f8905d)\n\nThe must-have app for NBA bettors\n\nThe best NBA betting scoreboard\n\nFree picks from proven pros\n\nLive win probabilities for your bets\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLuka Doncic Over 6.5 1Q Points\n------------------------------\n\nBy \n\nDoncic has reached seven first-quarter points in 10-of-12 games this postseason, and he's accomplished the feat in 4-of-5 matchups against Minnesota since the Gobert trade.\n\nThe Wolves shut down paint attempts this season, but opponents were able to exploit the mid-range. Doncic possesses an excellent in-between game, and his tendency to launch from deep off-the-dribble also adds plenty of upside.\n\nFinally, he's superb at drawing contact, and Minnesota has given up a large free-throw attempt rate all season.\n\nDoncic looked relatively healthy in Game 6 against Oklahoma City, and he enters this contest with three full days of rest. Look for him to be aggressive early.\n\n#### **Pick: Luka Doncic Over 6.5 1Q Points**\n\n* * *\n\nLuka Doncic Leading Scorer +115\n-------------------------------\n\nBy \n\nJaden McDaniels is a great defender, and it showed against the smaller Jamal Murray. Luka is just so much bigger, and he uses his size with such an elite craft.\n\nI'm looking to play Luka points overs because I think he's going to be able to create a lot for himself, and the length of the Wolves may cause problems for the surrounding players.\n\nConsidering the low game total and vig prices on other bets, I considered Luka Over 28.5 at -110, over 30 at +110 and leading scorer at +115.\n\nGive me the highest payment in a threshold he can still hit scoring only 27 if this game is a sub-200 total.\n\n#### **Pick: Luka Doncic Leading Scorer +115**\n\n* * *\n\nLuka Doncic Over 28.5 Points\n----------------------------\n\nBy \n\nI’m targeting Doncic to have a big game.\n\nLuka’s points prop is set at 28.5, a number he's crushed this season. Overall, Luka has averaged 32.9 points per game, but he's had some difficulty in the playoffs, scoring just 27.3 a night.\n\nMuch of this was due to matchups, though. The Clippers could throw a mix of Kawhi Leonard and Terance Mann at him, while Oklahoma City deployed Lu Dort.\n\nWhile the Timberwolves have elite wing defenders — such as McDaniels (who I expect to start of Luka) — Luka’s size should give him the edge.\n\nAlso, Luka was seemingly dealing with a knee injury throughout the Oklahoma City series but got into his stride to finish the series with 31- and 29-point performances.\n\nHere, I think Minnesota has better options to defend everyone else on the Mavericks, with Ant on Kyrie and Gobert clogging up the interior.\n\nMinnesota’s defense is elite, but Luka is a tough cover due to his skill.\n\nI’ll grab Luka to exceed 28.5 points, especially with him playing on extra rest.\n\n#### **Pick: Luka Doncic Over 28.5 Points**\n\n* * *\n\n<table

Wright\n\nUpdated on May 21, 2024 3:00 AM\n\n!in 2 regular-season games against Minnesota this season, Luka Doncic averaged 36.5 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 10.5 assists.\n\n**• **\n\nConsider this series a rarity, given Game 1 marks just the second postseason series between these teams. The last playoff matchup between these clubs came in the opening round of the 2002 playoffs, when a 57-win Dallas squad defeated Minnesota 3-0 before falling in the next round to Sacramento.\n\nInterestingly, two years later, Minnesota advanced to its only appearance in the conference finals.\n\nSuperstars Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards have faced off 10 times in the regular season with each player coming away with five wins. The Timberwolves finished 3-1 against Dallas during the 2023-24 regular season, but Doncic missed two of those games while Kyrie Irving sat out three.\n\n* * *\n\n**Series schedule**\n\nHere’s how to watch the Mavericks vs. Timberwolves series:\n\n_All times Eastern Standard Time_\n\n**Game 1:** Mavericks vs. Timberwolves, Wednesday, May 22 (8:30 p.m., TNT)  \n**Game 2:** Mavericks vs. Timberwolves, Friday, May 24 (8:30 p.m., TNT)  \n**Game 3:** Timberwolves vs. Mavericks, Sunday, May 26 (8:00 p.m, TNT)  \n**Game 4:** Timberwolves vs. Mavericks, Tuesday, May 28 (8:30 p.m, TNT)  \n**Game 5:** Mavericks vs. Timberwolves, Thursday, May 30 (8:30 p.m, TNT) \\*  \n**Game 6:** Timberwolves vs. Mavericks, Saturday, June 1 (8:30 p.m, TNT) \\*  \n**Game 7:** Mavericks vs. Timberwolves, Monday, June 3 (8:30 p.m, TNT) \\*\n\n_\\* = If necessary_\n\n* * *\n\n**Top storyline**\n\nNaturally, all eyes immediately focus on young superstars Doncic and Edwards. Why not? The Mavericks guard finished third in voting for Kia MVP, while Edwards received the seventh-most votes for the award. Expect both players to generate plenty of eye-popping plays in this matchup. Doncic averages 24.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 1.4 steals in clashes with Edwards.\n\nThe Timberwolves star produces similar numbers in head-to-head battles against Doncic (23.9 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 4.7 apg, 1.1 spg), the NBA’s leading scorer this season. It’s expected Edwards will guard Doncic’s co-star Kyrie Irving (a difficult challenge), while Jaden McDaniels starts on Doncic.\n\n* * *\n\n**Keep your eyes on**\n\n**The new matchups on both sides.** Minnesota won the regular-season series, 3-1. But those games were before Dallas brought in Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington at the trade deadline. That changes how these teams will match up. Expect rookie Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford to take turns on Rudy Gobert, while Washington likely draws the Karl-Anthony Towns assignment. Doncic should guard Mike Conley with Derrick Jones Jr. taking Edwards.\n\n* * *\n\n**1 more thing to watch for each team**\n\n**For Mavericks:** Minnesota owns a reputation for suffocating defense, but don’t sleep on what Dallas has done in that department since the end of the regular season. The Mavericks rank sixth in postseason defensive rating (110.6), just two spots behind the Timberwolves (107.6) and a major reason for the team’s overall success on that end is Doncic’s participation.\n\n**For Timberwolves:** Dallas dominated the paint against the smaller Oklahoma City Thunder in the last round. But Minnesota’s bigs — Gobert, Towns and Kia NBA Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid — present a more daunting challenge. The Mavs have secured at least 14 offensive rebounds in four games so far in the playoffs. Look for Minnesota to limit those precious second-chance scoring opportunities in this series.\n\n* * *\n\n**Key number to know**\n\n**19.4** — Over their 11 playoff games, the Wolves have been  better in the second half (plus-18.4) than they’ve been in the first half (minus-1.0). They’ve trailed  of the 11 games at halftime, but have won four of those seven, with the highlight being their comeback  early in the third quarter of Game 7 in Denver on Sunday.\n\nThe half-to-half difference has been almost entirely about offense. The Wolves have had the playoffs’  (106.7 points scored per 100 possessions) and its  (125.8 scored per 100). Led by Jaden McDaniels () and Mike Conley (), five of their top eight guys have significant differentials in their effective field goal percentage before halftime vs. after halftime.\n\nThe Mavs have also been much better after halftime () than in the first and second quarters (minus-3.0), with that difference also being more about offense than defense. But in the four regular-season meetings, the Wolves were  (with Dallas scoring less than a point per possession) after halftime.\n\n_— John Schuhmann_\n\n* * *\n\n**The pick**\n\n**Mavericks in seven.** It feels like Minnesota’s time, but that’s the same vibe emanating from Dallas, which is playing in the conference finals for the second time in three seasons. As skilled as Irving and Doncic are, they also possess the experience on this stage that Minnesota lacks. Edwards will undoubtedly put together some electrifying performances. But can he do it for a grueling seven games in consecutive series? Dallas seems to be peaking at the right time.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n_Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

For the first time in six tries under coach Jason Kidd, the Mavericks won the first game of a playoff series.\n\n had his third straight 20-plus-point game with 24 points for the Wolves, but Edwards — who earned his first  selection prior to the game, on the second team — was stifled for 19 points in a team effort from the Mavericks.  needed a late burst to get to 16 points and finished 6 for 20 from the floor.\n\nThe star power in this series is strong, and for the first night at least the Mavericks got what they needed from their leading duo while the Wolves largely struggled to run the offense around theirs.\n\n“Terrible offense down the stretch: bad shots, turnovers, no composure,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “We've got to be better in clutch moments.”\n\nTowns came to life with a long jumper, a lob to  for a slam and a 3-pointer on a 2-minute burst to give the Wolves the lead back with 4:39 to go on the way to a 10-0 run that Doncic ended with a 3-pointer. , who had 13 points and seven rebounds, hit from deep to put the Mavericks back in front with 1:56 to go.\n\nTowns thought he tied the game with a putback dunk on the next possession, but that was waved off for basket interference.\n\nMinnesota hosts Game 2 on Friday night.\n\nEdwards, who went scoreless in the third quarter, added 11 rebounds and eight assists.\n\n“He’s an amazing player. We have to put multiple bodies on him,” Doncic said. “If he’s going 1-on-1, it’s kind of tough to stop him.”\n\n had 15 points and  added 11 points off the bench for the Wolves, who had two days off after dethroning defending champion Denver with a Game 7 comeback from a 20-point deficit to win the second-round series.\n\nThe transition was sharp from the Nuggets and NBA MVP Nikola Jokic’s deliberate and powerful style to the pick-and-roll-heavy Mavericks, who frequently lost their opponents off screens for wide-open dunks. They moved with a purpose that kept the Wolves from consistently setting their half-court defense around the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Gobert at the rim.\n\nIrving’s stunning burst on the break and on the drive presented a unique challenge the Wolves and their league-leading defense didn’t face in the last round, when they held the Nuggets to an average of 85 points over their four wins.\n\n“He got us going. Without him, we would probably be down 20 at halftime,” Doncic said. “I had to help him in the second half a little bit. So we switched roles this time.”\n\nMcDaniels, who played his usual relentless defense on the perimeter, was the catalyst on the other end of the court too with five 3-pointers in the first half, but Towns had trouble getting shots to fall and Edwards found his driving lanes constantly clogged.\n\n“Jaden was the only one that came ready to play tonight,” Edwards said, “and I think everyone else let him down.”\n\nThe Mavericks have cranked up their defense since adding  and Washington at the trade deadline, as top-seeded Oklahoma City can attest after losing in six games in the last round. Doncic chipped in, too, breaking up a lob from  to Gobert for one of his three steals with 1:06 remaining and the Mavericks leading by two.\n\n“No one panicked. There was just a lot of trust, no matter how bad or how good we’re playing,” Kidd said.\n\n\\------\n\nAP NBA: \n</web doc>\n\n"},

After a rocky first three games, it almost seemed like the Wolves got some of their swagger back in Game 4. The Timberwolves sit as 4.5-point favorites tonight, but can they pull off the comeback? Regardless, tonight should be fun, so we have you covered with everything you need to know, as well as a +1100 ultimate same-game parlay.\n\nLet’s have ourselves a night!\n\n_Dunk on the sportsbooks tonight! SportsGrid’s free , , and ._\n\n**8:30 p.m. ET:** **No. 5 Dallas Mavericks @ No. 3 Minnesota Timberwolves** **(Mavericks Lead 3-1)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Spread:** Timberwolves -4.5 | **Moneyline:** Timberwolves -194 | **Total:** 209.5\n*   **Where to Watch:** TNT | **Location:** Target Center (Minneapolis, MN)\n\n**Mavericks Last 5 ATS:** 3-2 | **Timberwolves** **Last** **5 ATS:** 2-3\n\n**SportsGrid’s Best Bets**: Mavericks +4.5 (1-Star) | UNDER 209.5 (2-Stars)\n\n**SportsGrid’s Top Player Props**: **** OVER 3.5 Three-Point FG Made (4.5-Stars) | **** UNDER 11.5 Rebounds (5-Stars)\n\n**Elsewhere Around the Association**\n------------------------------------\n\n**_NBA Headliners:_  | **\n\n\n\n**Timberwolves-Mavericks +1100 SGP**\n====================================\n\n_Dunk on the sportsbooks tonight! SportsGrid’s free , , and ._\n\n**Legs 1 & 2: Luka Doncic 3+ Threes, 8+ Rebounds**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**** has **knocked down at least three shots from beyond the arc in each game this series**, averaging 10.8 attempts from deep per game. If Luka chucks up at least ten shots from deep, I’ll undoubtedly count on him being able to knock down three. His rebound production is coming off a **15-rebound performance in Game 4**, so I trust he can rack up eight tonight.\n\n**Legs 3 & 4: PJ Washington Jr. 2+ Threes, 4+ Rebounds**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**** has **made at least two threes in nine of his last ten games**, and he’s **grabbed at least four rebounds in every playoff game thus far**. What else is there to ask for?\n\n**Leg 5: Daniel Gafford 5+ Rebounds**\n-------------------------------------\n\n didn’t play in Game 4, allowing  to **play 31 minutes and grab eight rebounds**. Lively is questionable tonight, and even if he does play, I can still imagine Gafford playing more than his average minutes workload, ultimately giving him more than enough chances to grab at least five rebounds.\n\n**Legs 6 & 7: Anthony Edwards 6+ Assists, 5+ Rebounds**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n has **averaged 8.3 assists and 8.8 rebounds this series**, **eclipsing the six-assist and five-rebound marks in each game**. He will want to put his team on his back again, so I expect his production to stay intact in the Wolves’ biggest game on their home floor.\n\n**Leg 8: Mike Conley 10+ Points**\n---------------------------------\n\n has **averaged 16.0 points over his last three games**, and it’s almost felt as if the Mavs are letting Conley get his shots up relatively quickly. They aren’t too worried about him beating them. At the minimum, he should be able to navigate to double-digit points.\n\n**Leg 9: Rudy Gobert 10+ Points**\n---------------------------------\n\nLike with **Mike Conley**, the Mavs defensively don’t pay _much_ attention to ****, as he’s had **at least ten points in three of four games this series**, with the one miss being a nine-point outing. He’s taking few shots, but he’s doing an excellent job of camping out around the rim and putting up easy looks while getting to the free-throw line a fair amount. All of that combined should be enough to get us double-digit points.\n\n_Odds Courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook_\n\n!\n\nMORE ARTICLES\n-------------\n\n NBA · 7 hours ago NBA Player Props: Expert Picks for Monday, Oct. 28 Paul Connor](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/nba-player-props-expert-picks-for-monday-oct-28) NBA · 7 hours ago NBA 2024-25 Western Conference Rankings According to NBA GMs John Canady](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/nba-2024-25-western-conference-rankings-according-to-nba-gms) NBA · 8 hours ago Top 5 NBA Player Performance Doubles for Monday's Slate Ben DiGiacomo](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/top-5-nba-player-peformance-doubles-for-mondays-slate) NBA · 2 days ago NBA 2024-25 Eastern Conference Rankings Top 7 According to NBA GMs John Canady](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/nba-2024-25-eastern-conference-rankings-according-to-nba-gms) NBA · 3 days ago Top 5 NBA Player Peformance Doubles for Friday's Slate Ben DiGiacomo](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/top-5-nba-player-peformance-doubles-for-fridays-slate) NBA · 3 days ago NBA Player Props: Expert Picks for Friday, Oct. 25 Paul Connor](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/nba-player-props-expert-picks-for-friday-oct-25) NBA · 4 days ago NBA Player Props: Expert Picks for Thursday, Oct. 24 Paul Connor](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/nba-player-props-expert-picks-for-thursday-oct-24) NBA · 5 days ago NBA Player Props: Expert Picks for Wednesday, Oct. 23 Paul Connor](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/nba-player-props-expert-picks-for-wednesday-oct-23) NBA · 5 days ago NBA 2024-25 Season Individual Awards Predictions | NBA Picks & Best Bets Ben DiGiacomo](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/nba-2024-25-season-individual-awards-predictions-nba-picks-best-bets) NBA · 5 days ago Top 6 NBA Player Peformance Doubles for Wednesday's Slate Ben DiGiacomo](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/article/top-6-nba-player-peformance-doubles-for-wednesdays-slate)\n\nLOAD MORE\n\n‌  \n\n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n\n‌  \n\n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n\n‌  \n\n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n\n!\n\nSPORTSGRID APP NOW AVAILABLE IN THE IOS APP STORE\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\n‌  \n\n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n\n‌  \n\n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n\n‌  \n\n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n‌  \n\nOUR SHOWS\n---------\n\n](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/ferrall-coast-to-coast)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/college-football-today)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/pro-football-today)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/bare-knuckle-fighting-main-event)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/in-game-live-prime-time)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/the-early-line-live)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/sportsrage-late-night-live)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/newswire-live)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/the-bostonian-vs-the-book)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/knuckle-up)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/modus-super-series-darts)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/game-time-decisions-live)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/sportsgrid-2024-nfl-draft-special)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/fantasy-sports-today-1)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/the-smylie-kaufman-show)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/sportsgrid-2024-nba-draft-special)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/kaplan-crew)](https://www.sportsgrid.com/shows/college-football-today-update-1)\n\nWherever you are, SportsGrid can be there too.

Still, he is set to miss his first game since January 15. The Mavs have provided no timetable for his return, so unless this is a more serious issue, he should be able to return Saturday vs. the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nKyrie Irving, meanwhile, sustained a right thumb sprain a couple of weeks ago. This injury has sidelined him for a few games and Wednesday's game will be the fifth in a row that the superstar guard will sit out. Like Doncic, he has no official timetable to return, but he could be available for the battle against the Bucks on Saturday.\n\nHow to watch the Dallas Mavericks vs. Minnesota Timberwolves game?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves will play their next three games at home. Their first opponent will be the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday. The Wolves will host the Mavs at Target Center in Minneapolis and tip-off time is 8:00 pm ET.\n\nInternational fans can watch the game on NBA League Pass. Bally Sports North and Bally Sports Dallas will broadcast the contest for local fans. The Mavs will look to earn the victory in this one and even the season series.\n\n×\n\nFeedback !\n\nWhy did you not like this content?\n\n*    Clickbait / Misleading\n*    Factually Incorrect\n*    Hateful or Abusive\n*    Baseless Opinion\n*    Too Many Ads\n*    Other\n\nCancel Submit\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n!\n\n!\n\nThank You for feedback\n\n Fan?

Its majority owner is , who also owns the 's . Currently, Taylor is in a legal battle over ownership of the team with , , and . The Timberwolves play their home games at , their home since 1990.\n\nLike most , the Timberwolves struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of  in the , the team qualified for the  in eight consecutive seasons from  to . Despite losing in the first round in their first seven attempts, the Timberwolves won their first division championship in  and advanced to the  that same season. Garnett was also named the  for that season. The team then went into rebuilding mode for more than a decade after missing the postseason in 2005, and trading Garnett to the  in 2007. Garnett returned to the Timberwolves in a February 2015 trade and finished his career there, retiring in the 2016 off-season. The Timberwolves ended a 14-year playoff drought when they returned to the postseason in .\n\n### 1989–1995: Team creation and early years\n\n\\\\]\n\nNBA basketball returned to the  in 1989 for the first time since the  (1947–1960) departed to  in . The NBA had granted one of its four new expansion teams on April 22, 1987 (the others being the , , and the ) to original owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson to begin play beginning in the . There were two previous  (ABA) franchises that played in between the Lakers' departure and the Timberwolves arrival: the  (1967–68), and the  (1968–69). The Timberwolves have worn throwback uniforms for each of the previous franchises.\n\nThe franchise conducted a \"name the team\" contest and eventually selected two finalists, \"Timberwolves\" and \"Polars\", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner and \"Timberwolves\" prevailed by nearly 2–1. The team was officially named the \"Minnesota Timberwolves\" on January 23, 1987. Minnesota is home to the largest population of  in the contiguous 48 states.\n\nThe Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the  on the road 106–94. Five days later, they made their home debut at the , losing to the  96–84. Two nights later on November 10, the Wolves got their first win, beating the  at home 125–118. The Timberwolves, led by  with 23.2 ppg, went on to a 22–60 record, finishing in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Playing in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the expansion Timberwolves set an NBA record by drawing over 1 million fans to their home games. This included a crowd of 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the  99–88 in the final home game of the season.\n\nThe next , the team moved into their permanent home, the , and improved somewhat, finishing 29–53. However, they fired their head coach, . They fared far worse in the  under Musselman's successor, ex- coach  \"Jimmy Rodgers (basketball)\"), finishing with an NBA-worst 15–67 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former  general manager  to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as  and , the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's \"Detroit Bad Boys\" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19–63 and 20–62 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from that era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994  where Rider won the  with his between-the-leg \"East Bay Funk Dunk\".\n\nAs winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson  in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually,  bought the team and named  \"Kevin McHale (basketball)\") general manager. The Wolves finished 21–61 in 1994–95, and the future looked bleak.\n\n### 1995–2007: The Kevin Garnett era\n\n\\\\]\n\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kevin_Garnett_with_the_Minnesota_Timberwolves_dunking,_2007.jpg)\n\n played for the Timberwolves from 1995 to 2007 before returning in 2015.\n\nIn the , the Timberwolves selected high school standout  in the first round (5th overall), and  was named head coach.  was traded along with  to the  for  \"Andrew Lang (basketball)\") and . Also, first-round pick  was traded the previous season for ' forward . These trades paved the way for rookie Kevin Garnett to become the go-to player inside. Garnett went on to average 10.4 ppg in his rookie season as the Wolves finished in 5th place in the Midwest Division, with a 26–56 record.\n\nIn 1996, the Wolves added another star player in the draft, trading  to the  for the rights to , the 4th overall pick. The addition of Marbury had a positive effect on the entire team, as Garnett and Gugliotta became the first Wolves to be selected to the All-Star team. Gugliotta and Garnett led the Timberwolves in scoring as the team made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 40–42. However,  the Timberwolves made a quick exit as they were swept by the  in three straight games. The T-Wolves also decided to change their image by changing their team logo and color scheme, adding black to the team colors and replacing the original logo with one featuring a snarling wolf looming over a field of trees. It was also during this season that Minnesota began to play on a .\n\nIn 1997, Garnett and Marbury established themselves as two of the brightest rising stars in the . Garnett averaged 18.5 ppg and 9.6 rebounds per game, while Marbury averaged 17.7 ppg and dished out 8.6 assists per game. Despite losing leading scorer Tom Gugliotta for half the season, the Timberwolves went on to post their first winning season at 45–37, making the playoffs for the second straight season. After dropping Game 1 of the playoffs on the road to the , the Timberwolves won their first postseason game in Game 2, winning in  98–93. As the series shifted to Minnesota, the Timberwolves had an opportunity to pull off the upset as they won Game 3 by a score of 98–90. However, the Wolves dropped Game 4 at home as the Sonics went on to win the series in five games.\n\nIn 1998, a year after signing Kevin Garnett to a six-year, $126 million contract, the Timberwolves were then used as the poster child of irresponsible spending as the NBA endured a four-month lockout that wiped out much of the season. With an already cap-heavy payroll, the Wolves let Tom Gugliotta walk, partially because the team wanted to save money in order to sign Stephon Marbury to a long-term contract, and in part because Gugliotta did not want to play with the young player. This move proved unsuccessful, however, as Stephon Marbury wanted to be the biggest star on a team and subsequently forced an in-season trade by refusing a contract extension. In the three-team mid-season deal that sent Marbury to the , the Wolves got  in return and a first-round draft pick in the 1999 draft (which turned out to be the sixth pick). The Wolves made the playoffs for the third straight season by finishing in fourth place with a 25–25 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were beaten by the eventual champion  in four games.\n\nIn 1999, the Timberwolves drafted  with the sixth pick in the draft. He had a solid season, finishing third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Led by Kevin Garnett, who averaged 22.9 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game, the Timberwolves had their first 50-win season and finished in 3rd place with a record of 50–32. However, in the playoffs the Wolves again fell in the first round, losing to the  in four games. The Wolves opened the 1999–2000 regular season with two home games against the  at the  on November 6 and 7.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, guard  was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Sealy's number has since been retired: the number 2 jersey memorialized with Sealy's name on a banner hanging from the rafters of Target Center. It remains the only number retired by the team.\n\nAlso in that season, a free agent deal signed by  \"Joe Smith (basketball)\") was voided by the NBA, who ruled that the Timberwolves violated proper procedure in signing the contract. The league stripped the Timberwolves of five draft picks (first round 2001–2005), but it was eventually reduced to three first-round picks (2001, 2002, and 2004). The league also fined the Timberwolves $3.5 million and suspended general manager Kevin McHale for one year. Smith eventually signed with the  before re-signing with the Timberwolves in 2001. Despite those setbacks, the Timberwolves made the playoffs for the fifth straight season with a 47–35 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round again by the  in four games in the spring of 2001.\n\nA number of newcomers arrived prior to the start of the next season, including ,  and  \"Maurice Evans (basketball)\") and the return of  \"Joe Smith (basketball)\"). The Timberwolves started the season by winning their first six games and went on to achieve a franchise-best start of 30–10. The Timberwolves had a franchise-record 53-point win over  in November. They finished with a 50–32 record: their second-ever 50-win season that was highlighted by another All-Star appearance by Garnett and a breakout season by , who earned his first All-Star appearance. Once again, Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the  in three straight games.\n\nThe  seemed to look up for the Timberwolves. Garnett had a great season where he finished second in  voting with 23.0 points per game and 13.4 rebounds per game and the Timberwolves finished in third place with a 51–31 record. As a result, they were awarded home-court advantage for the first time when facing the three-time defending champion . After losing at home in Game 1, the Timberwolves had a chance to take a 3–1 series lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 4 in Los Angeles, but the Lakers came back to win the game and eventually won the series in six games. In the end, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the seventh straight year.\n\n#### 2003–04 season: Western Conference finals appearance\n\n\\\\]\n\nIn 2003,  was promoted to vice-president of player personnel. He and general manager  \"Kevin McHale (basketball)\") made a series of strong off-season moves in an attempt to get the team over the hump and beyond the first round of the playoffs. They made two important trades, sending away forward  \"Joe Smith (basketball)\") and guard  in a multi-player deal for ,  and embattled guard . They also signed sharp-shooter , and former first overall pick  as free agents, with both becoming key contributors during the season. The Timberwolves rounded out their bench by signing veteran role players , , and  \"Mark Madsen (basketball)\").\n\nDespite injuries to a revitalized Olowokandi (who missed half the season) and 6th man  (who only played in 28 games), the revamped Timberwolves became the team to beat during the , finishing the season as the top seed in the Western Conference with a record of 58–24. Garnett had his best season to date, and both Sprewell and Cassell had career years as well. Garnett and Cassell both made , and after the season, Garnett was named , and earned his first  averaging 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.\n\nDuring the , the Wolves won their first-ever playoff series against the , before beating the  in a hard-fought seven-game series to advance to the franchise's first Western Conference finals.  leapt upon the scorer's table upon the winning Game 7 in the Sacramento series, which became one of the more iconic moments in Minnesota sports history. The Timberwolves' run ended in the Western Conference finals as the team lost to the .  injured his groin during Game 7 against the Kings, doing his infamous _big balls_ dance after knocking down the series-clinching bucket, and as a result, played only sparingly during the Lakers series.

After a disappointing start to the season, head coach  was replaced by general manager and long-time friend  \"Kevin McHale (basketball)\"), who took over as coach for the rest of the season. Despite a strong finish, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, by one game, to the , ending the season with a record of 44–38.\n\nDuring the 2005 off-season, McHale and the Wolves started their search for a head coach.

In a separate trade on the same day, the Timberwolves traded Tskitishvili to the  for a 2006 second-round draft pick. The Timberwolves finished 33–49, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.\n\nIn the , the Timberwolves selected future   with the 6th overall pick,  \"Craig Smith (basketball, born 1983)\") with the 36th pick, forward  \"Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1984)\") with the 37th pick and center  with the 57th pick. The Timberwolves traded Roy to the  for  and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded  \"Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1984)\") to the  for a 2007 second-round pick and cash.\n\nOn January 23, McHale fired head coach Casey and replaced him with .

On October 10, The Wolves lost to Garnett and the revamped Celtics, 92–81. To start the season, the Wolves began 0–5 before ending the drought with a home win over the .

McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years.\n\nThose questions seemed to be answered when the Timberwolves went 10–4 for the month of January, giving McHale the coach of the month honors. But on February 8, 2009, the team's main star  tore his  in his right knee in a game at , sidelining him for the rest of the season.

Deep in the forest, he grew with a love for something never before seen by others in his pack. Crunch's love for the game of basketball puzzled his mother and father, for he seemed to pick up the game on his own. With a makeshift basket built of pine-cones and birch bark, Crunch began to refine his game when he was still just a young pup. He learned the rules and techniques that make the game of basketball so great. He studied players and coaches alike, and soon would find himself on a journey like no other. Years later, when Minnesota’s expansion team, the Timberwolves, came to town, Crunch said goodbye to all he had known growing up in the woods, and migrated south to the Twin Cities where the team was to be based. No one is quite sure where Crunch lives, but legend has it he has a den somewhere deep inside the Target Center. He is lured out on game-days by the deafening howl made by Wolves fans. This howl creates an atmosphere in the Target Center that reminds Crunch of his days back in the forest, and yet keeps him here in Minneapolis, with the pursuit of helping the team to a victory.\"\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><b>Arenas</b></td></tr><tr><th>Arena</th><th>Tenure</th></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome\" title=\"Hubert H.
